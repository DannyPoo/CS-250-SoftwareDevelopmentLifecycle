How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? When working in a team it is great to be able to ask the user directly what they need and then implement into the user stories and that way you can elobrorate on anything that you may be confused about.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? One of the best ways to approach developing programs is trying to figures out what you need and what structure you are going to follow. You should maybe create user stories so you know what requirements you need for the software.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  Being a good team member is being able to do the part you are assigned to effiectvely and making sure that you can communicate with everyone effectively. Say you are a good developer but are not great a communicating then its going to be very hard to work in a team environment.
